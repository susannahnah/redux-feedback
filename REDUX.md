WHAT IS REDUX??
**redux is basically a store on the client side that stores data**

WHY IS REDUX???
**I assume it helps keep things organized before sending things to the database**

HOW (do we use ) REDUX???
**lots and lots of cursing.  we dispatch an action, create reducers (functions ) for those actions to send to the big store on the client side.  We then connect it back to the React UI**


GOOD PRATICE - use JSON to post onto the DOM

use <Link to="/link">This is the link</Link> 

to only have home page on home page, create new component and call it "HomePage.js", then keep only routes on App
