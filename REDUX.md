WHAT IS REDUX??
**redux is basically a store on the client side that stores data**

WHY IS REDUX???
**I assume it helps keep things organized before sending things to the database**

HOW (do we use ) REDUX???
**lots and lots of cursing.  we dispatch an action, create reducers (functions ) for those actions to send to the big store on the client side.  We then connect it back to the React UI**
